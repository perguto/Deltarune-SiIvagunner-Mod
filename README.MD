![splash.png](./splash.jpg)

A very high quality mod for Deltarune, containing EVERY rip from SiIvagunner and Timmy Turner's Grand Dad.

## How to Use

1. Copy your Deltarune folder (i. e. the folder that contains DELTARUNE.exe; it can be found in "SteamLibrary/steamapps/common" if you've got the game from Steam) and name the copy anything you like, for example "NUTDEALER".
2. Download this mod by clicking the green button that reads "Code" on this page and choosing "Download as ZIP".
3. Replace the audio by just pulling the contents of the zipfile into your copied Deltarune music and choosing "replace" for all files.
4. Delete or rename "steam_api.dll" (Otherwise the game won't let you start.)
